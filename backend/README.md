Creating a README for your NestJS cryptocurrency price tracking app is essential for providing users and collaborators with information about how to set up, use, and contribute to your project. Below is a sample README template that you can use as a starting point. Be sure to customize it with specific details about your project:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed (Node.js version 14+ recommended)
- MySQL database server installed and running
- NestJS CLI installed (`npm install -g @nestjs/cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crypto-price-backend.git
   cd crypto-price-backend
   ```

2. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. Database Configuration:

   - Create a MySQL database for the application.
   - Configure the database connection by editing the `.env` file. Replace the placeholders with your database credentials.

   ```env
   DATABASE_HOST=localhost
   DATABASE_PORT=3306
   DATABASE_USERNAME=user
   DATABASE_PASSWORD=pass
   DATABASE_NAME=test
   ```

2. Environment Variables:

   - Create a `.env` file to store environment-specific configuration. You can use `.env` for development and `.env.test` for testing. Example:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=mysql://your_username:your_password@localhost:3306/crypto_prices
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

2. The application will start and periodically fetch cryptocurrency prices from an external source and store them in the MySQL database.

3. You can access the API at `http://localhost:3000` (or your specified port) to retrieve cryptocurrency price data.

## Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm test
```
